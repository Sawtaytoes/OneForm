# Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
OneForm requires React.
{% endhint %}

With `npm`:

```bash
npm install @oneform/react
```

Or with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @oneform/react
```

### Browser Support

OneForm only supports evergreen browsers. If you wanna use IE11, you'll have to polyfill around it as it's using the latest available ECMAScript standards.
