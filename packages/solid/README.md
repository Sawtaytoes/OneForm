_The OneForm you need!_

**üìù Official Docs: https://docs.oneform.dev **

## Features

* No external dependencies \(except [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)\).
* Super clean API.
* Validation and group validation built-in.
* Write your own validations or use your favorite library.
* Works with both standard HTML elements and custom Solid components.
* Minuscule bundle size.
* Ridiculously fast. Built to never be a bottleneck.

## Installation

With `npm`:

```bash
npm install @oneform/solid
```

Or with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @oneform/solid
```

## Quick Start

With OneForm, you don't need to worry about forms ever again. Not because it's the best form library out there, but because it doubles as a state manager. Yes, that means you could build an entire Solid app with OneForm! Now, you're playing with power!

Here's a simple example of OneForm in action:

```jsx
<OneForm>
  <Field>
    <input name="message" />
  </Field>
</OneForm>
```

No magic, it _just works_. Don't believe me? Here's a realistic example:

```jsx
import {
  Input,
} from '@material-ui/core'
import {
  Field,
  OneForm,
} from '@oneform/solid'

<OneForm
  onSubmit={({
    registeredValues,
  }) => (
    // Do stuff, then tell OneForm you're done.
    Promise
    .resolve()
  )}
>
  <Field>
    <Input name="email" />
  </Field>
  <Field>
    <Input name="password" />
  </Field>
  <div>
    <button type="submit">
      Submit
    </button>
  </div>
</OneForm>
```

**OneForm handles everything for you.** Values, errors, messages, submit button disabling, `onChange` handlers, etc. Unlike other form libraries, you don't have to pass any special props to `Field`, just give it an input, and you're ready to go!

## Caveats

To use `Field`, there is a caveat. Your input component needs to have a `name` prop and it needs to accept a `value` prop. Even if it doesn't, no big deal, there's a field translation component which will customize `Field` for your particular components.

## Special Thanks

This project wasn't just something I came up with in a bubble. It was brought on by the fact I, and the others I worked with, wanted a better experience building complex forms.

These are the folks at Minted that played a big part in the creation of Minted Forms \(which was _the_ inspiration for `OneForm`\):

* Rebekah Heacock Jones
* Peter Carnesciali
* Everyone else at Minted!

### The logo is important too!

The logo and title are courtesy of **Noah Raskin**. He does some amazing graphic design and even creates custom icon libraries! Talk about dedication to small details!

While this logo looks simple, there's a lot going on behind the scenes, and the way he shaded it amazed me as much as the cleanliness of OneForm's API.
