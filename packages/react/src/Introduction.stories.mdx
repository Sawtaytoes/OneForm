# OneForm

The OneForm you need!

With OneForm, you don't need to worry about forms ever again. Not because it's the best form library out there, but because it doubles as a state manager. Yes, that means you could build an entire React app with OneForm! Now, you're playing with power!

Here's a simple example of OneForm in action:
```jsx
<OneForm>
  <Field>
    <input name="message" />
  </Field>
</OneForm>
```

No magic, it _just works_. Don't believe me? Here's a realistic example:

```jsx
import {
  Input,
} from '@material-ui/core'
import {
  Field,
  OneForm,
} from '@oneform/react'

<OneForm
  onSubmit={({
    registeredValues,
  }) => (
    // Do stuff, then tell OneForm you're done.
    Promise
    .resolve()
  )}
>
  <Field>
    <Input name="email" />
  </Field>
  <Field>
    <Input name="password" />
  </Field>
  <div>
    <button type="submit">
      Submit
    </button>
  </div>
</OneForm>
```

**OneForm handles everything for you.** Values, errors, messages, submit button disabling, `onChange` handlers, etc. Unlike other form libraries, you don't have to pass any special props to `Field`, just give it an input, and you're ready to go!

To use `Field`, there is a caveat though. Your input component needs to have 3 props on it and accept a few specific prop names to work properly. Even if it doesn't, no big deal, there's a field translation component which will customize `Field` for your particular components.
