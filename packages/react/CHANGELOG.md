# 0.2.0
_March 29th, 2021_

- ðŸ’¥ API changes:
	+ `validations` now takes a `getIsValid` function rather than `validate`. This function now receives an object with a `values` prop.
	+ `groupValidations` takes a `getErrorMessages` function and the return value is now an `errorMessages` object, the same as you pass into `OneForm` with the only difference being you can return a string rather than an array of error messages.
- There were quite a few bugs with `groupValidations`. Those are fixed in this version.
	+ There's currently one issue with `groupValidations`:
		* If you have two which take the exact same field names (and they share or both don't have `groupNames`, their errors will interfere with each other.
		* This will be fixed in a later update.
		* A workaround, if you're using `groupNames` is to swap the order of them in both group validations.
- The entire underlying error message system has been completely rewritten from the ground up.
