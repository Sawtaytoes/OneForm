# Creation story

I built OneForm to solve the problem of sub-par form solutions in React once and for all.

I'm sure you've heard of the other 4 popular libraries \(ordered by popularity\):

* Formik
* React Hook Form
* Redux Form
* React Final Form

{% page-ref page="../compare-oneform-to-others/" %}

Of four major libraries available, all of them have some major flaw and require lots of work from the user to maintain form state.

OneForm is designed to do all the heavy-lifting, so you can **concentrate on building your app**.
