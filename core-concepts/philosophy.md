# Philosophy

I built OneForm to solve the problem of sub-par form solutions once and for all.

Of options I saw, one of them required render props \(a performance no-no\), another required adding a `ref` prop to each component and didn't even use React, another just wasn't popular but was supposed to be the better solution, and the fourth one used Redux.

I bet you can name all four of those libraries. I wasn't the one doing the initial research, but I did take a look. The original implementation of OneForm was built at Minted on company time and rewritten from scratch for the open source community. I wanted to do things I couldn't where I worked because of time constraints and rewriting it from scratch would allow me to own the library and make those changes.

OneForm solves the problems of forms by putting itself forward as a state manager first and a form library second. Because of that, it has a ton of horsepower to build complex forms and anything basic looks ridiculously simple in comparison. From my perspective, I've achieved my goal, but I also need people to use it.

I'm on a quest to have created the best form library out there, the OneForm you need. While I might be in last place today, I'm aiming for the top spot. Formik, I'm coming for you.
