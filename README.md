# Introduction

OneForm is a form library.

I built OneForm to solve these problems...

* What is it
* why was it created
* who is it for? EVERYONE who uses React.

## Special Thanks

While I wrote `OneForm`, this project wasn't just something I came up with in a bubble. This library came about from a need at Minted to have highly-customizable complex forms.

These are the folks at Minted that played a big part in the creation of Minted Forms \(the inspiration for `OneForm`\):

* Giselle Ghadyani
* Rebekah Heacock Jones
* Peter Carnesciali
* Everyone else at Minted!

  **Special Thanks2**
