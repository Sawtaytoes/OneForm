description: What is OneForm and who is it for?

# Introduction

OneForm is a form library.

I built OneForm to solve these problems...

* What is it
* why was it created
* who is it for? EVERYONE who uses React.

## Special Thanks

This project wasn't just something I came up with in a bubble. It was brought on by the fact I, and the others I worked with, wanted a better experience building complex forms.

These are the folks at Minted that played a big part in the creation of Minted Forms \(which was _the_ inspiration for `OneForm`\):

* Giselle Ghadyani
* Rebekah Heacock Jones
* Peter Carnesciali
* Everyone else at Minted!
