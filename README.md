# Introduction

## What is OneForm?

OneForm is a form library.

> Okay... So what's that mean to me?

OneForm is a way to manage the state of your form.

Just about every developer uses forms, and you'll almost always run into a situation where you're requirements are too complex for a simple solution.

That's where OneForm comes in. It's very plug 'n play.

Unlike other popular form libraries, OneForm requires no special setup.

### What does OneForm solve?

OneForm solves the problem of maintaining form state in React.

There are plenty of similar libraries, but even the most-popular are flawed. 

OneForm can be _the_ solution to form state in React; the **one form library you need!**

### Who needs OneForm?

Everyone.

* Even for simple forms with a select box and a button, I recommend OneForm.
* Even if you don't have a submit button, I recommend OneForm.

If your form is extremely complex and has multiple dynamic fields and those dynamic fields render other dynamic fields, and you also need to some how maintain validation that queries the values of multiple fields, OneForm is most-definitely the **only** solution I'd recommend.

And if you need to build an application, and you want to use a state manager that's not Redux or MobX, use OneForm. Yes, it's completely possible. I think you'll be surprised at how easy it can be. While OneForm is primarily a form library, it's only this powerful because it's also a state manager.

## Special Thanks

While Kevin Ghadyani is the creator of `OneForm`, he didn't make it in a bubble.

The ideas behind this library originated from a need at Minted to have highly-customizable complex forms.

The original implementation was closed-source and other folks at Minted played a big part its creation:

* Giselle Ghadyani
* Rebekah Heacock Jones
* Peter Carnesciali
* Everyone else at Minted!

### The logo is important too!

The logo and title are courtesy of **Noah Raskin**. He does some amazing graphic design and even creates custom icon libraries. Talk about dedication to small details!

While this logo looks simple, there's a lot going on behind the scenes. The way he shaded it is as amazing as the cleanliness of OneForm's API.
