# Compare OneForm

Formik took the number one spot in the React ecosystem over the last few years as Redux Form fell out of favor. It's major competitor is React Hook Form and all three libraries use entirely different form methodologies.  
  
Another popular library, React Final Form, was made by the author of Redux Form using what he learned to make a better library. Sadly, that library has less popularity and is pretty different in how it's setup. Like Formik, both libraries primarily use render props.
