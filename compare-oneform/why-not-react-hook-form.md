# Why not React Hook Form?

I'm gonna rag on React Hook Form, but that in no way makes it a horrible library or a poor choice of a library.

The reason you choose a library is up to the needs of your team and your project. I would argue that OneForm is the one form library you need, but that's my opinion. You're free make these choices on your own ;\).
