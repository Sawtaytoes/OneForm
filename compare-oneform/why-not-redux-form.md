# Why not Redux Form?

I'm gonna rag on Redux Form, but that in no way makes it a horrible library or a poor choice of a library; although, they'll tell you that themselves right on the homepage :p.

The reason you choose a library is up to the needs of your team and your project. I would argue that OneForm is the one form library you need, but that's my opinion. You're free make these choices on your own ;\).
