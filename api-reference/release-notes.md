## 0.5.1 <a id="051"></a>

* ✨ `Field` correctly handles `multiselect` values as an array.
* ✨ `groups` and `groupsString` are now available in a `groupValidations`‘s `getErrorMessages()` function. This allows getting IDs for `groupNames` values when returning error messages.

## 0.4.2 <a id="042"></a>

_April 5th, 2021_

* ✨ `SubmitField` disables itself when submitting.

## 0.4.1 <a id="041"></a>

## 0.3.2 <a id="032"></a>

_April 5th, 2021_

* 🐛 Subsequent values from `onChange` are now correctly being set as visited.
* 🐛 `updatedValues` is now correctly setting those values to visited.

## 0.3.1 <a id="031"></a>

_April 5th, 2021_

* 🐛 Fixed a bug where passing `values` caused all values to first get set to `undefined` and then given a new value if passed. Now, this is done in a single step, so it will only set to the values passed or `undefined`, not both.
* 🐛 Fixed a regression where returned `values` from `onChange` weren’t modifying OneForm’s state.
* 🐛 Fixed a bug where passing `errorMessages` would remove all other origins. Now it properly only clears the external origin of `errorMessages` and `updatedErrorMessages`.

## 0.3.0 <a id="030"></a>

_April 5th, 2021_

* ✨ `FieldValue` and `FieldErrorMessage` can now render `children` into `children`.
* ✨ `FieldValue` and `FieldErrorMessage` now optionally take a `fallback` and `getIsVisible` prop.
* ✨ Error messages now use the same signature as the return value from `groupValidations` meaning they can be `true`, a string, or an array of strings. The array no longer needs to contain valid values either. If passed `false`, `null`, or `undefined`, those error messages are skipped.
* ✨ `Field` now sets different props depending on if it’s been given an HTML element or React component.
* 🐛 `Field` now sets `error` as a boolean rather than a string. This fixes errors in Material-UI’s `TextInput`.
* 🐛 Fixed a bug where checkboxes weren’t set to visited on mount which is required for validating against them. This was fixed by looking for a checkbox input or a component with “checkbox” in the name.

## 0.2.2 <a id="022"></a>

_March 29th, 2021_

* 🐛 Fixed a bug where multiple `groupValidations` that shared the same `fieldNames` and `groupNames` \(in the same order\) would have conflicts on which errors would show and which wouldn’t show.

## 0.2.1 <a id="021"></a>

_March 29th, 2021_

* 📝 Added logo to README on npm.

## 0.2.0 <a id="020"></a>

_March 29th, 2021_

* 💥 API changes:
  * `validations` now takes a `getIsValid` function rather than `validate`. This function now receives an object with a `values` prop.
  * `groupValidations` takes a `getErrorMessages` function and the return value is now an `errorMessages` object, the same as you pass into `OneForm` with the only difference being you can return a string rather than an array of error messages.
* There were quite a few bugs with `groupValidations`. Those are fixed in this version.
  * 🐛 There’s currently one issue with `groupValidations`:
    * If you have two which take the exact same field names \(and they share or both don’t have `groupNames`, their errors will interfere with each other.
    * This will be fixed in a later update.
    * A workaround is to change the order of `fieldNames` and `groupNames` your validations.
* ♻️ The entire error message system has been completely rewritten from the ground up.
